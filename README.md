# Instant Reality: Gaze-Contingent Perceptual Optimization for 3D Immersive Streaming

This main branch demonstrates the computation pipeline of the proposed method without neural acceleration.

For demo on the neural acceleration, please switch to the neural-acceleration branch.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository. Make sure to pass the ``--recursive`` flag when cloning, or ``git submodule update --init`` after cloning to get all the dependencies
- Use cmake and Visual Studio 2019 to compile the code
- Set Glitter as the startup project in VS2019 and run
- Put on your HTC Vive Pro Eye headset and press key Q to start the streaming
